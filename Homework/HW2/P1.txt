part_c_explain=The variance here evaluates how inbalanced the orrurance of letters is.
	In particular, if the string is 'abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz' or any of its permutation,
	the population variance will be 0, meaning that all letters occur at the same frequency.
	According to the dictionary, English texts, in general, are not evenly distributed,
	so the population variance should be greater than zero.
	Indeed, from part (a), we get 0.001..., and so is the plaintext.
	However, if the plaintext is encryped by a Vigen√®re cipher, the origin distribution is also breaked,
	making the letters distributed more evenly.
	Thus, the population variance has a trend to decrease (to zero).
